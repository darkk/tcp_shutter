This module calls shutdown() on every TCP socket that got no packets (either
data or ACK) from the peer for the specified amount of time.  It's ugly
workaround for lack of timeout options in zillion of network libraries.
shutdown() call unlocks thread that's locked on recv() or send() call.

The module is not portable and uses Linux-specific TCP_INFO structure.
